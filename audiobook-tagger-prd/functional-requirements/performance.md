# Performance Considerations

## 2.5 Performance Considerations

The Audiobook Tagger is designed with performance optimization in mind to handle libraries of various sizes efficiently and provide a responsive user experience.

### Processing Targets

#### File Processing Time

- **3-10 seconds per file**
  - Typical processing time for standard files with good matching data
  - Includes metadata retrieval, validation, and application

- **Acceptable maximum: 30 seconds per file**
  - For complex cases requiring multiple API calls
  - Files with minimal existing metadata requiring extensive searching
  - Large files with chapter extraction needs

- **User feedback during extended processing**
  - Progress indicators for operations exceeding 5 seconds
  - Cancelable operations when appropriate
  - Background processing options for longer tasks

#### Concurrent Processing

- **1-50 files**
  - Scalable batch processing capability
  - Adjustable concurrency based on system resources
  - Queue management for larger batches

- **Throttling mechanisms**
  - Automatic rate limiting to respect API constraints
  - User-configurable concurrent operation limits
  - Adaptive throttling based on system performance

#### Minimal Resource Consumption

- **Efficient memory usage**
  - Peak usage under 500MB for normal operation
  - Progressive loading for large libraries
  - Memory cleanup during idle periods

- **Low CPU overhead**
  - Background processing prioritization
  - Multi-threading for parallel operations
  - Efficient algorithms for common operations

- **Scalable architecture**
  - Performance scaling with available system resources
  - Graceful degradation on limited systems
  - Optional resource usage caps

### Optimization Strategies

#### Asynchronous Processing

- **Non-blocking operations**
  - UI remains responsive during processing
  - Real-time progress updates
  - Cancelable background tasks

- **Promise-based architecture**
  - Well-structured async operation flow
  - Proper error handling and recovery
  - Chainable operations for complex workflows

#### Efficient Job Queuing System

- **Prioritized job queue**
  - Critical operations prioritized
  - User-initiated tasks take precedence
  - Background tasks yield to interactive operations

- **Queue visualization**
  - Clear display of pending operations
  - Estimated completion times
  - Individual job progress tracking

#### Incremental Metadata Loading

- **Progressive detail retrieval**
  - Essential metadata loaded first
  - Supplementary details retrieved on demand
  - Background completion of full metadata

- **Smart prefetching**
  - Anticipatory loading of likely-to-be-needed data
  - Batch retrieval for related items
  - Caching of frequently accessed information

#### Caching Mechanisms

- **Local metadata cache**
  - Recently used item retention
  - Persistent storage between sessions
  - Intelligent cache invalidation

- **API response caching**
  - Elimination of redundant network requests
  - TTL-based cache freshness
  - Force refresh option for updated data
