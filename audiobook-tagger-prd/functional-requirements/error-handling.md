# Error Handling and Logging

## 2.3 Error Handling and Logging

Effective error handling and comprehensive logging are critical for ensuring the Audiobook Tagger functions reliably and provides users with clear information about any issues encountered.

### Error Message Requirements

#### Detailed Error Information

1. **Exact action attempted**
   - Specific operation being performed (e.g., "Searched by ASIN")
   - Context of the operation (e.g., file being processed)
   - Stage in the workflow where error occurred

2. **Specific failure point**
   - Precise identification of what failed (e.g., "No match found")
   - Error codes when applicable
   - Component or service that generated the error

3. **Attempted search parameters**
   - Search terms used
   - API endpoints queried
   - Filters or options applied

4. **Potential reason for failure**
   - Common error causes explained in plain language
   - Distinction between system errors and data issues
   - Identification of network vs. local problems

5. **Suggested next steps for resolution**
   - Clear guidance on potential fixes
   - Alternative approaches to try
   - Links to relevant documentation when appropriate

### Error Logging Specifications

#### Logging Features

1. **Automatically generated error log**
   - Timestamped entries for all errors
   - Severity level classification
   - Persistent storage across sessions

2. **Option to export error log**
   - Multiple format options (TXT, CSV, JSON)
   - Filtering capabilities for export
   - Inclusion of system information for troubleshooting

3. **Detailed file-specific error information**
   - Full file path and name
   - File format and size
   - Current metadata state
   - Attempted changes

4. **Timestamp of attempted processing**
   - Operation start time
   - Error occurrence time
   - Duration of operation before failure

5. **Attempted search methods**
   - Search strategy employed
   - API requests with parameters
   - Response codes and headers

### Error Handling Workflow

#### Metadata Retrieval Attempt Fails

1. **Generate detailed error message**
   - User-friendly notification
   - Technical details available on demand
   - Severity indication

2. **Provide manual editing option**
   - Direct transition to manual metadata entry
   - Pre-populated fields with available data
   - Field validation to prevent further errors

3. **Allow manual search/metadata entry**
   - Alternative search terms suggestion
   - Manual ASIN entry option
   - Template-based metadata completion

4. **Option to modify search parameters**
   - Adjust confidence thresholds
   - Try alternative matching methods
   - Change metadata source priority

#### Skipped File Handling

1. **Comprehensive error reporting**
   - Log entry for skipped file
   - Reason for skipping
   - Flagging for later review

2. **Clear indication of why file was skipped**
   - User notification with specific reason
   - Visual indication in file list
   - Filter option to view skipped files

3. **Option for manual intervention**
   - Retry option with modified parameters
   - Manual metadata assignment capability
   - Batch retry for common error types
