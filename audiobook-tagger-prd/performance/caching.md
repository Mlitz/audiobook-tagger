# Caching Mechanisms

## 4.3 Caching Mechanisms

The Audiobook Tagger implements comprehensive caching strategies to minimize redundant operations, reduce network usage, and provide a responsive user experience.

### 4.3.1 Metadata Cache

#### Local Cache Storage

- **Persistent local cache for frequently accessed metadata**
  - SQLite database for structured metadata storage
  - JSON serialization for complex objects
  - Binary storage for efficient retrieval

- **Cache invalidation policies based on age and relevance**
  - Time-based expiration for potentially volatile data
  - Access frequency tracking for cache prioritization
  - User-configurable retention periods

- **Memory-based quick cache for session operations**
  - In-memory caching for current session data
  - LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy
  - Size limits based on available system memory

#### API Response Caching

- **Intelligent caching of API responses**
  - Full response caching for identical requests
  - HTTP caching headers support
  - ETag and conditional request implementation

- **Cache sharing between related operations**
  - Entity-based cache organization
  - Relationship tracking between cached items
  - Cascade invalidation for related entities

- **Configurable TTL (Time To Live) based on data type**
  - Short TTL for frequently changing data (ratings, popularity)
  - Medium TTL for semi-stable data (descriptions, metadata)
  - Long TTL for static data (historical information, release dates)

#### Differential Updates

- **Change tracking for efficient updates**
  - Modification timestamps for all cached entities
  - Delta update support for partial changes
  - Change log for synchronization

- **Minimal network payload for refreshes**
  - Conditional requests using If-Modified-Since
  - Partial response support for field-level updates
  - Compression of update payloads

- **Background refresh strategies**
  - Proactive refresh before expiration
  - Off-peak update scheduling
  - Prioritized updates based on user activity

### 4.3.2 Asset Caching

#### Cover Art Management

- **Local storage of processed images**
  - Filesystem cache with organized structure
  - Multiple resolutions for different view contexts
  - Optimized formats for quick loading

- **Resolution-appropriate image caching**
  - Thumbnail generation and caching
  - Medium resolution for list views
  - High resolution for detailed views

- **Lazy loading of non-visible assets**
  - Viewport-based loading prioritization
  - Scroll prediction for anticipatory loading
  - Background processing during idle periods

#### Resource Prefetching

- **Predictive loading based on user patterns**
  - Analysis of navigation patterns
  - Preloading of frequently accessed sequences
  - Learning algorithm for improving predictions

- **Background fetching during idle periods**
  - Detection of system idle state
  - Low-priority background downloads
  - Progressive quality enhancement

- **Cancellable prefetch operations**
  - Priority reassignment for user-initiated requests
  - Resource reclamation for canceled operations
  - Partial result utilization when appropriate

### 4.3.3 Search Results Caching

#### Query Result Caching

- **Cached results for recent searches**
  - Complete result set storage for identical queries
  - Parameterized query caching
  - Supplementary metadata prefetching

- **Incremental search optimization**
  - Progressive result filtering for typeahead
  - Intermediate result caching
  - Character-by-character optimization

- **Filter and sort acceleration**
  - Cached index structures for common sort fields
  - Pre-computed filtering for frequent criteria
  - Combined filter+sort optimization

#### Semantic Caching

- **Related query identification**
  - Recognition of query similarities
  - Result subset relationships
  - Query containment detection

- **Partial result reuse**
  - Leveraging existing results for new queries
  - Delta computation for related searches
  - Cache composition from multiple sources

- **Proactive caching for related content**
  - Author-related content preloading
  - Series-based anticipatory caching
  - Genre association prefetching

### 4.3.4 Cache Management

#### Size and Retention Policies

- **Configurable cache size limits**
  - Overall storage budget
  - Category-specific allocations
  - Automatic adjustment based on available space

- **Intelligent eviction strategies**
  - Access frequency analysis
  - Recency-weighted usage metrics
  - Value-based retention scoring

- **Manual cache management options**
  - User-initiated cache clearing
  - Selective purging by category
  - Export/import capability for cache migration

#### Cache Integrity

- **Validation mechanisms**
  - Checksum verification for cached content
  - Version metadata for compatibility checking
  - Corruption detection and recovery

- **Automatic repair and regeneration**
  - Self-healing for detected corruption
  - Background regeneration of invalid entries
  - Fallback to source retrieval for irreparable items

- **Cache coherence across components**
  - Synchronized invalidation
  - Transaction-based updates
  - Atomic operation support
