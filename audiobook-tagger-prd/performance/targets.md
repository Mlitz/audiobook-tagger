# Performance Targets

## 4.1 Performance Targets

The Audiobook Tagger establishes clear performance targets to ensure a responsive, efficient application experience even with large libraries and complex operations.

### 4.1.1 Processing Efficiency

#### File Processing Time

- **Target: 3-10 seconds per file for standard metadata operations**
  - Typical processing including API lookup and metadata application
  - Network requests completed within 2-5 seconds
  - Metadata writing operations under 3 seconds

- **Maximum: 30 seconds for complex operations**
  - Extended processing for files requiring extensive metadata + cover art
  - Complex chapter detection and marking
  - Multiple API source lookups

- **Timeout mechanisms for stalled processes**
  - Configurable timeout thresholds (default: 45 seconds)
  - Graceful termination of unresponsive operations
  - User notification with retry options

#### Batch Processing Capabilities

- **Support for 1-50 files in a single batch**
  - Smooth processing without UI degradation
  - Progress tracking for individual files and overall batch
  - Prioritization framework for critical files

- **Graceful scaling with increased file counts**
  - Linear performance scaling up to 100 files
  - Sub-linear degradation beyond 100 files
  - Smart batching for very large collections (500+ files)

- **Queue management for larger libraries**
  - Background processing queue with priority levels
  - Intelligent scheduling to minimize resource contention
  - Pause/resume capability for long-running operations

#### Resource Utilization

- **CPU: < 30% utilization on a modern quad-core system during normal operation**
  - Background processing limited to 15% when application is in foreground
  - Multi-threaded operations with configurable thread count
  - Adaptive usage based on system capabilities

- **Memory: < 500MB base footprint with efficient scaling**
  - Initial memory allocation under 250MB
  - Linear scaling up to 1GB for libraries up to 10,000 files
  - Memory cleanup during idle periods

- **Network: Intelligent bandwidth management for API calls**
  - Concurrent connections limited to 5 by default
  - Request compression when supported
  - Background transfers throttled when UI is active

### 4.1.2 Responsiveness

#### UI Interaction

- **< 100ms response time for UI actions**
  - Immediate feedback for button clicks and control interactions
  - Smooth animations running at 60fps
  - Input latency under 50ms

- **< 1s for data operations without API calls**
  - Local database queries completed within 500ms
  - File system operations under 1s for typical files
  - Local image processing within 2s

- **Non-blocking UI during background operations**
  - Separate thread for all potentially lengthy operations
  - UI thread prioritization
  - Throttling of background operations when UI is active

#### Feedback Timing

- **Immediate visual feedback for user actions**
  - Button state changes within 50ms
  - Selection highlighting immediate
  - Input validation feedback within 100ms

- **Progress updates at minimum 1-second intervals**
  - Smooth progress bar animations
  - Percentage complete updates
  - Time remaining calculations refreshed every 2 seconds

- **Responsive cancellation of operations**
  - Cancel request acknowledged within 100ms
  - Operation termination within 500ms when possible
  - Clear indication of cancellation in progress for longer operations

### 4.1.3 Startup and Load Time

#### Application Launch

- **Cold start: < 3 seconds**
  - Initial window display within 1 second
  - Core functionality available within 2 seconds
  - Complete initialization within 3 seconds

- **Warm start: < 1.5 seconds**
  - Window display within 500ms
  - Full functionality within 1.5 seconds
  - Cache utilization to accelerate common operations

#### Library Loading

- **Small libraries (< 100 files): < 2 seconds**
  - Complete library scan and display within 2 seconds
  - Metadata fully loaded at startup
  - Cover art loaded on demand with caching

- **Medium libraries (100-1,000 files): < 5 seconds**
  - Initial display of latest/most accessed files within 2 seconds
  - Complete library index loaded within 5 seconds
  - Background loading of additional metadata

- **Large libraries (> 1,000 files): Progressive loading**
  - First page of results within 3 seconds
  - Background indexing with progress indication
  - On-demand loading of folder contents and metadata
